# Project Specification: AI-Powered Productivity App

## Overview

An AI-powered productivity agent that learns from user habits, prioritizes work, and helps maintain productivity while recording achievements on a decentralized blockchain.

## Core Features

1. **Task Management**

   - Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete.
   - Task prioritization with color-coded labels (ðŸ”¥ High, âš¡ Medium, ðŸ“Œ Low).
   - Basic streak tracking for consistency.

2. **AI Agent Integration**

   - Task prioritization suggestions based on deadlines and urgency.
   - Reminders for overdue tasks.
   - Optional productivity insights (e.g., "You complete 80% of tasks before noon").

3. **Blockchain Integration**

   - Task completion verification by storing task hashes on-chain.
   - Basic reputation score computation and storage.
   - Wallet authentication using MetaMask/Phantom.

4. **User Authentication & Data Storage**

   - JWT authentication for secure user sessions.
   - Task data stored off-chain using Supabase.

5. **UI/UX Design**
   - Minimalist design with a main dashboard and dedicated sections.
   - Task list interface with Kanban or simple list view.
   - AI assistant as a floating chatbot or inline suggestions.
   - Smooth Web3 login experience.

## Architecture Choices

- **Frontend & Backend**: Next.js for both frontend and backend, leveraging server-side rendering and API routes.
- **UI Components**: Shadcn for modern UI components.
- **Database**: Supabase for real-time data management and authentication.
- **Blockchain**: EVM-based chain (e.g., Polygon) for smart contract deployment.
- **AI Model**: Claude or OpenAI's GPT models for task prioritization and reminders.

## Data Handling

- **Encryption**: Use HTTPS for data transmission and Supabase's encryption for data storage.
- **Access Control**: Implement RBAC to ensure users access only their data.
- **Data Privacy**: Anonymize data sent to AI models to maintain user privacy.

## Error Handling Strategies

- **Frontend**: Implement user-friendly error messages and fallback UI components.
- **Backend**: Use try-catch blocks and error logging for API routes.
- **Blockchain**: Handle transaction failures gracefully with user notifications.
- **AI Interactions**: Implement retries and default responses for AI model failures.

## Testing Plan

1. **Unit Testing**:

   - Test core functionalities like task CRUD operations and AI suggestions.
   - Use Jest or a similar testing framework.

2. **Integration Testing**:

   - Test interactions between frontend, backend, and blockchain components.
   - Use Cypress or a similar tool for end-to-end testing.

3. **Smart Contract Testing**:

   - Use Truffle or Hardhat for testing smart contracts on a local blockchain.

4. **User Acceptance Testing**:
   - Gather feedback from initial users to refine features and UI/UX.

## Deployment

- **Platform**: Vercel for deploying the Next.js application.
- **Continuous Deployment**: Set up automatic deployments from the Git repository.
